    <h2>Description & Reviews</h2>
    <h4>An Oreo cookie crust adds a chocolate flavor dimension to this <i>classic</i>,
         <i>creamy</i> Oreo cheesecake.</h4>
        <p>"This was great! The first cheesecake I ever made - super easy. After reading
             many reviews, and other cheesecake hints I made exactly as directed but 
             added an additional 1/2 cup of sugar and doubled the vanilla. I baked it 
             in a water bath and took it out at 50 minutes with the center still wobbly.
            Let it set until it separated from the spring pan then refrigerated it 
            until time to serve. Very, very creamy. Will make again!" - Debbi Necker Thompson</p>
        <p>"My granddaughter requested an OREO cheesecake for her birthday and this 
            is the recipe I used. I did bake it in a water bath and added a dash of 
            almond extract along with the vanilla extract. I decorated the top with 
            whipped cream and mini OREO bites. Will be making again!" - JimmyandNancy Long</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
            <ul>

                <li>⅓ cup butter or margarine, melted</li>
                <li>3 (8 ounce) packages PHILADELPHIA Cream Cheese, softened</li>
                <li>¾ cup sugar</li>
                <li>1 cup BREAKSTONE'S or KNUDSEN Sour Cream</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon vanilla</li>
                <li>4 eggs</li>
            </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
                <li>Crush 28 cookies finely; coarsely chop remaining cookies. 
                    Mix finely crushed cookies with butter in a bowl; press 
                    mixture onto the bottom and 2 inches up the sides of a 9-inch 
                    springform pan.</li>
                <li>Beat cream cheese and sugar in a large bowl with an electric 
                    mixer until blended. Add sour cream and vanilla; mix well. 
                    Add eggs, one at a time, mixing on low speed after each addition.
