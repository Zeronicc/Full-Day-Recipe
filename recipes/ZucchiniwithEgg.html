            <h4> It is so simple, yet it is so <i>yummy</i>! It is great in the summer and even better with homegrown zucchini.</h4>
                <p>"Zucchini, it's good for breakfast too! As an Italian who grew up with this 
                    humble dish herself (using the summer zucchini bounty from Grandma's and Mom's
                    plentiful gardens) I can vouch for its satisfying deliciousness. Or maybe 
                    I'm just swayed by sentimentality. While olive oil is a kitchen staple, in 
                    this instance I've always preferred to make this with butter. And, while 
                    zucchini is a great foundation, it needn't stop there. I added onion and 
                    minced garlic today, but tomatoes and/or mushrooms are great additions as 
                    well. To finish, I like a sprinkle of freshly grated Parmesan upon serving." -naples34102</p>
                    <p>"I really enjoyed this dish as a light supper on a very warm summer evening. 
                    I used butter instead of the olive oil. I added onions to the zucchini as 
                    well as minced fresh garlic a few minutes before the zucchini was done. 
                    Also added a small chopped tomato before it was finished. The parmesan cheese 
                    worked well here. Since it was dinner, I had a glass of chilled rose wine with
                    it. I'll bet they do that in Italy (at dinner, that is). Thanks for the recipe;
                    it's a good one!" - Ms Jean</p>
